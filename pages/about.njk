    <h2 class="feature-headline">We create open digital experiences</h2>

    <p>Our team works across the world. The range of disciplines we represent is almost as wide as our global reach, from UX researchers and digital designers to developers and content strategists. We create digital experiences that are scalable and open.</p>

            <h3>PatternFly collaboration</h3>
            <p>We collaborate with <a href="https://www.patternfly.org">PatternFly</a>, the team responsible for enterprise application design. Using their open source design system as a foundation gives us the resources we need to create intuitive and scalable branded experiences for users across marketing, product, and support.</p>

            <h3>Shared language and vision</h3>
            <p>We share typography, scale, colors, and UI elements with PatternFly, so designers no longer need to reinvent the wheel when choosing a component or pattern to use. For example, an Accordion used in an enterprise application will look the same when used on our websites.</p>

            <h3>Web components</h3>
            <p>Our team is building an open source web component driven development system to build scalable UI elements. This <a href="https://patternfly.github.io/patternfly-elements/">open source community project</a> drives the code behind the design system along with custom code, which also supports many components in our design system.</p>
